# Krishi_Sahaytam 🌿

**Krishi Sahaytam** is an AI-powered plant disease detection system developed using **Edge Impulse**. It allows users—especially farmers and agricultural workers—to detect plant diseases in **real-time** simply by scanning the leaf of the plant with a mobile device.

## 📅 Project Timeline
- **Developed:** January 2025
- **Dataset Source:** [Kaggle - Plant Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **Platform:** [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/)

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🌱 Real-time disease detection by scanning leaves.
- 📲 Mobile-friendly – works directly on smartphones.
- 🧠 Lightweight AI model optimized for edge devices.
- 💡 Helpful for early identification and prevention of crop damage.

---

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. The user opens the app powered by Edge Impulse.
2. They scan a leaf of the plant using the phone camera.
3. The model analyzes the leaf image and classifies it into **healthy** or **diseased**, specifying the type of disease if detected.

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset used for training was sourced from **Kaggle**, containing thousands of labeled plant leaf images across multiple classes (healthy + various diseases).

---

## 🧠 Model Training
- Model was trained on **Edge Impulse Studio**
- Used a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture.
- Achieved high accuracy on validation data.
- Optimized for edge deployment with quantization.
